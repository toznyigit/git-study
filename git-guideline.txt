git init:                               This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git directory
git commit -m "<message>":              Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes.
git status:                             Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, 
                                paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git.
git add <file>:                         This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, 
                                to prepare the content staged for the next commit.
git rm --cached <file>:                 Remove files matching pathspec from the index, or from the working tree and the index.
git log --oneline:                      Show log with one line.
git checkout <head-position>:           Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree.
                                #   head-position provided by yellow label which can be found begining of line. 'master' label can be used for head-position.
git revert:                             Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, 
                                and record some new commits that record them.
git reset:                              In the first three forms, copy entries from <tree-ish> to the index. In the last form, 
                                set the current branch head (HEAD) to <commit>, optionally modifying index and working tree to match.
git branch <new-branch>:                Create new branch as <new-branch>.
git branch -a:                          Checks all branches.
